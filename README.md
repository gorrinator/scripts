# Scripts
Collection of Python Scripts I've created to perform different tasks.

- convert.py - Converts a pre-defined XLS file to CSV and then saves to a pre-defined location.
- cv.py - Converts an XLS file selected via file dialog and saves the output CSV file to a pre-defined location.
- ns.py - Command line script which performs a full DNS lookup via an API and prints the results
- smtptest.py - Command line script which uses an API to query whether a specific email address exists on the SMTP Server
